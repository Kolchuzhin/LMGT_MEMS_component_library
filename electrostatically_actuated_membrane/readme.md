## APDL scripts for ANSYS ROM Tool:
* rom1_ememb2a.mac  =>  FE-model generation
* rom2_ememb2a.mac  => ROM-model generation
  
## VHDL-AMS model:
     
* FILE initial.vhd WRITTEN WITH INITIALIZATION DATA
* FILE s_ams_160.vhd WRITTEN CONTAINING RESPONSE SURFACE DATA FOR STRAIN ENERGY
* FILE ca12_ams_160.vhd WRITTEN CONTAINING RESPONSE SURFACE DATA FOR CAPACITANCE ca12
* FILE transducer.vhd WRITTEN CONTAINING PROBLEM SET-UP FOR VHDL-AMS SIMULATOR
     
* FILE testbench.vhd Testbench for model
     
     The VHDL-AMS files were compiled with hAMSter simulator.
     
## Applications:
* pressure sensor
* microphone
