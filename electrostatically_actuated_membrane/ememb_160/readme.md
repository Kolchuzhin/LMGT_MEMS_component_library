## APDL scripts for ANSYS ROM Tool:
* rom1_ememb2a.mac  =>  FE-model generation
* rom2_ememb2a.mac  => ROM-model generation
  
## VHDL-AMS model:
     
* initial.vhd      WRITTEN WITH INITIALIZATION DATA
* s_ams_160.vhd    WRITTEN CONTAINING RESPONSE SURFACE DATA FOR STRAIN ENERGY
* ca12_ams_160.vhd WRITTEN CONTAINING RESPONSE SURFACE DATA FOR CAPACITANCE ca12
* transducer.vhd   WRITTEN CONTAINING PROBLEM SET-UP FOR VHDL-AMS SIMULATOR
     
* testbench.vhd    Testbench for model
     
     The VHDL-AMS files were compiled with hAMSter simulator.
